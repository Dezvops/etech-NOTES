I was having all this issues when I try to push to my remote repo.

When I do a git pull, it says “fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories”, what do I do? 
This is so confusing and annoying

Why This Is Happening
The error occurs because Git is trying to merge two histories that don’t have a common ancestor:
Your local repository has its own commit history.
The remote repository (https://github.com/Dezvops/etech-NOTES.git, based on your previous context) has its own commit history.
Git doesn’t know how to automatically merge these unrelated histories, so it stops to avoid potential data loss.
This can happen in a few scenarios:
You initialized a new local Git repository (git init) and added commits, then tried to pull from a remote repository that was also independently initialized.
The remote repository was rewritten (e.g., someone force-pushed a new history to main, erasing the previous history).
You might have cloned a different repository or reset your local history at some point, creating a mismatch.

How to Fix It
There are a few ways to resolve this issue, depending on your goal. Since you’re trying to sync your local repository with the remote, I’ll outline the most common approaches.
Option 1: Allow Unrelated Histories with `--allow-unrelated-histories`
Git provides a flag to explicitly allow merging unrelated histories. This will combine the histories of your local and remote repositories, even if they don’t share a common ancestor.
Run the following command:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

origin is the remote (GitHub repository).
main is the branch you’re pulling from.
--allow-unrelated-histories tells Git to merge the histories, even if they’re unrelated.
Resolve Any Merge Conflicts (if they occur):
If there are conflicts, Git will pause the merge and show the conflicting files.
Check the conflicted files with:
git status

Open each conflicted file, resolve the conflicts by editing the sections marked with <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>, and then stage the resolved files:
git add

Complete the merge:
git commit

Push Your Changes (if needed): After the merge, your local repository will have both histories combined. You can now push your changes to the remote:
git push origin main

When to Use This Option
Use this if you want to keep both the local and remote histories and merge them together.
This is a good choice if your local changes are important, and you also want to keep the remote changes.

Option 2: Overwrite Local History with Remote History
If you don’t care about your local commit history and just want to sync with the remote repository, you can reset your local repository to match the remote.
Backup Your Local Changes (just in case): If you have uncommitted changes or commits you want to save, create a backup:
Copy your entire repository folder to a safe location, or
Create a temporary branch to save your local commits:
git checkout -b backup-branch
git push origin backup-branch

Reset Your Local Repository: First, fetch the remote history without merging:
git fetch origin

Then, reset your local main branch to match the remote main:
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

git fetch origin retrieves the remote history.
git reset --hard origin/main overwrites your local main branch with the remote main branch, discarding your local history.
Verify the State: Your local repository should now be in sync with the remote. Check with:
git status

It should say something like: Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
When to Use This Option
Use this if you don’t need your local commit history and just want to work with the remote repository’s history.


This is a good choice if your local repository has no important changes, or if the remote repository is the “source of truth.”

Option 3: Start Fresh with the Remote Repository
If your local repository is expendable (e.g., you don’t have any important changes), you can start over by cloning the remote repository anew.
Backup Your Local Repository (just in case): Copy your current repository folder to a safe location, or commit and push your changes to a temporary branch (as shown in Option 2).
Delete Your Local Repository: Delete the current local repository folder.
Clone the Remote Repository: Clone the repository again:
git clone https://github.com/Dezvops/etech-NOTES.git
cd etech-NOTES

Add Your Changes: If you have files or changes you want to keep, copy them from your backup into the newly cloned repository, commit, and push:
git add .
git commit -m "Add my changes"
git push origin main

When to Use This Option
Use this if your local repository is in a messy state and you’d rather start fresh.
This is a good choice if you don’t have many local changes or if you’re okay manually reapplying them.

Option 4: Rebase Your Local Changes onto the Remote History
If you want to keep your local commits but apply them on top of the remote history (instead of merging), you can use git rebase.
Fetch the Remote History:
git fetch origin

Rebase Your Local Changes:
git rebase origin/main

This will take your local commits and replay them on top of the remote main branch.
If there are conflicts, Git will pause and let you resolve them:
Edit the conflicting files.
Stage the resolved files:
git add

Continue the rebase:
git rebase --continue

Push Your Changes: After the rebase, your local history will be linear, with your commits on top of the remote history. Push to the remote:
git push origin main

If the remote history has changed since your last fetch, you might need to force push (be cautious):
git push origin main --force

When to Use This Option
Use this if you want a clean, linear history without a merge commit.
This is a good choice if you’re comfortable with rebasing and want to avoid a merge commit in your history.

Recommended Approach
Since you’re working in a repository with Terraform files (as seen in your previous context), and you might have important local changes (e.g., in attack_key/backend.tf or other files), I recommend starting with Option 1: Allow Unrelated Histories. This approach preserves both your local and remote changes and allows you to resolve any conflicts manually.
Here’s the quick command sequence:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
# Resolve any conflicts, then:
git add   # For each resolved file
git commit
git push origin main
If you don’t care about your local history and just want to sync with the remote, go with Option 2:
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

Additional Tips
Prevent Future Issues: To avoid this in the future, always start by cloning the remote repository (git clone) rather than initializing a new one locally (git init) if you plan to work with an existing remote.
Check Remote History: If you’re collaborating with others, check if someone force-pushed to the remote, as that can cause history mismatches. Communicate with your team to avoid such issues.
Terraform Context: Since you’re working with Terraform files, after resolving the Git issue, ensure your Terraform configuration is still valid by running:
terraform init
terraform validate
